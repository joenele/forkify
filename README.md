# forkify
Forkify is a vanilla Javascript application that interacted with the forkify API to get and display food recipes. The app uses modern JavaScript tools such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and, Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, adjust their serving size, and add the ingredients to their shopping list. They can also save their favourite recipes via local storage.

The app is deployed and available to use via:

Fokify is a project from Jonas Schmedtmann's 'The Complete JavaScript Course' on Udemy.
